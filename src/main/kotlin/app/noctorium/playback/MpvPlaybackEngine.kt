/**
 * What the boost actually is: a compressor with make-up gain, and a limiter to catch what it throws.
 *
 * It used to be raw gain -- mpv's `volume` pushed to 200, then as far as 1000. That does not work, and
 * measuring it says why. mpv's volume is a cubic curve, so 200 is not twice as loud, it is eight times
 * the amplitude; against music mastered near full scale the samples saturate at once. Rendered to a file
 * and measured, a tone at volume 200 came out at exactly 100% of full scale, and at volume 400 it was
 * still exactly 100% -- louder by nothing at all, just squarer. Which is what the toggle was doing:
 * distortion, then no further change, which is exactly what it looks like when it appears to do nothing.
 *
 * Making something genuinely louder means raising the quiet parts rather than pushing the loud ones past
 * the ceiling. Same measurement, same tone, this chain: peak held at full scale and RMS -- which is what
 * loudness follows -- up from 8.8% to 63.8%. Seven times, and not a clipped sample in it.

     * connection; twenty seconds, so that a stream which has gone is noticed and fetched afresh while the
     * listener still thinks it is buffering.
     *
     * And, where this mpv fetches over curl, in bounded pieces rather than one open-ended request -- the way
     * yt-dlp itself downloads from YouTube. A dropped connection then costs one piece, which curl retries,
     * rather than the rest of the song.
     *
     * Each option only if this mpv has it. An option mpv does not recognise stops it from starting at all,
